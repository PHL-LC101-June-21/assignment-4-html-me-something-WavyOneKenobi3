               <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph"> I started my coding journey late, I never knew anything about coding or web design until late in my twenties. Besides the normal copy and pasting myspace html, I never had any practice or exposure to coding. My love and interest for computers made me search for new and better career paths that interest me and there I found that I could become a coder. Learning that I could potentially work from home or anywhere and get paid for it (years before the pandemic and working from home became the norm). My Next task was figuring out how I was going to learn this skill through schooling or other options.</p>

                    <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">After Months of research which involved a whole lot of google and youtube, I've decided I'm going to teach myself. Figuring out the coding path I wanted to follow was challenging but fun at the same time so I knew it was for me. Deciding what coding language and direction to go in was the first step, web design was first up and html & CSS was easy to learn but just didn't spark my interest as other things did. I quickly learned the basic and moved on to javascript. Javascript was another story learning on my own, difficult to say the least quickly decided it wasn't for me and moved on to other languages. Like a lot of beginners I tried more advanced languages that I wasn't ready for yet and realize I need to stick with one language and try to master it before moving on. For years I studied Python and got some what good with it but no clear path on what to do with the language.Trying a number of coding websites Javascript kept coming back as a basic skill I should know as a coding professional so I doubled back and to learn more of javascript.</p>

I'm not going to be those people you see on the web kicking robots, but helping robots to make our lives easier in any way possible. I know this goal will take some time to accomplish but its the goal and i will continue to work towards.</p>
