               <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">I started my coding journey late, i never knew anything about coding or web design until late in my twenties. Besides the normal copy and pasting of a myspace html i never had any practice or exposure to this world.My love and interest for computers made me search for new and better career paths that interest me and there i found that i could become a coder. Learning that I could potentally work from home or anywhere and get paid for it (way before the pandemic and working from home became the norm) this career path sparked my interest. My Next task was figuring out how I was going to learn this skill through schooling or other options. </p>

                    <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">After Months of research which invovoled a whole lot of google and youtube i've decided i'm going to learn on my own. Figuring out the coding path i wanted to follow was challeging but fun at the same time so i knew it was for me. Deciding what coding language and direction to go in was the first step, web design was first up and html & CSS was easy to learn but just didnt spark my interest as other things did. i quickly learned the basic and moved on to javascript.Now Javascript was another story learning on my own, challeging to say the least quickly decided it wasnt for me and moved on to other languages. Like a lot of beginners i tried advance languages that i wasn't ready for yet and realize i need to stick with one language and try and master it before moving on. For years i studied Python and got some what good with it but no clear path on what to do with the language.Trying a number of coding websites Javascript kept coming back as a basic skill I should know as a coding professional so i doubled back and tried to shaping a skills in javscript.</p>

I dont want to be one of those people kicking robots online but helping to make robots make our life easier in any possible way. I know this goal will take some time to acheive but its the goal and i will contiune to work towards it. </p>
